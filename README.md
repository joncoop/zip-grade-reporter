# ZipGrade Reporter

## About

ZipGrade Reporter is a tool that can process the CSV Export data from [ZipGrade](https://www.zipgrade.com/) and use it to generate small printable reports for students, give more detailed item analysis and test statistics, and provide you with a nice summary of grades and test data which you can save and view without needing access to your phone.

Check out a [sample report here](https://github.com/joncoop/zipgrade-reporter/raw/master/sample/sample_report.docx).

# How to Use

First, get the quiz data from your phone to your computer.

2. Choose the option "CSV - Full Data Format"
3. Send the file to your computer (perhaps through email or Google Drive)


Once you have the file, run ZipGrade Reporter. The app will ask you to

1. Click "Select CSV Data" button and navigate to the CSV data file you exported.
2. Click the "Generate Report" button.

Generating the report takes less than a second. The first page contains basic quiz summary statistics. The next page contains an alphabetized list of student names (if entered) and grades, and the remaining pages contain individual score reports. These pages can easily be cut up and distributed to students to save paper.
