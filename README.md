## About

ZipGrade Reporter is a tool that can process the CSV Export data from [ZipGrade](https://www.zipgrade.com/) and use it to generate reports in a Microsoft Word format. Reports contain detailed test statistics, score summaries by class, and individual score reports for distribution to students.

Check out a [sample report here](https://github.com/joncoop/zipgrade-reporter/raw/master/sample/sample_report.docx).

![Your Report is ready](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joncoop/zipgrade-reporter/master/screenshots/ready.png)

1. Click "Select CSV Data" button and navigate to the CSV data file you exported.
2. Click the "Generate Report" button.

Generating the report takes less than a second. The first page contains basic quiz summary statistics. The next page contains an alphabetized list of student names (if entered) and grades, and the remaining pages contain individual score reports. These pages can easily be cut up and distributed to students to save paper.
