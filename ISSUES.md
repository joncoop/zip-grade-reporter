## Pyinstaller

The Word template for PyInstaller was created on the 2013 Mac version. Because of this, the icon is wrong. I fixed this manually by upgrading template.docx in the docx package to the 2016 version. For an all-user Python installation, the template is located here:

    C:\Program Files\Python37\Lib\site-packages\docx\templates

On Windows 10, this needs to be installed for PyInstaller to work:
